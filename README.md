Here is a website that brings back many childhood memories from the 90s and early 2000s by showing 90s cartoons as gifs. This site uses api calls to generate gifs of the cartoons and also let's you put your favorite cartoon show and display it as a gif. The site shows 9 random gifs that are displayed after we click a button with the cartoon's name.
